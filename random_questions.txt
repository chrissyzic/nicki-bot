How do I make tweepy be OK with repeat tweets?
It's actually probably good that it's not

How do I check for unlimited mentions?
Change the "1" at the end of this line: mentions = api.mentions_timeline(count=1)

I assume I have to host these files on a serve to make them work? Help!

How do I store my consumer key and secret securely on a server?

Oh yeah, should I figure out how to follow anyone who tweets at me and/or mentions Nicki Minaj (latter might lead to spam issues)?
Yes, but be careful because Twitter only lets you follow 2,000 people. The best solution is to unfollow people randomly.

How do I ensure it doesn't keep trying to respond to the same person over and over?
Tell Python: Show me mentions since this status ID.
