How do I make tweepy be OK with repeat tweets?
How do I check for unlimited mentions?
I assume I have to host these files on a serve to make them work? Help!
How do I store my consumer key and secret securely?
Oh yeah, should I figure out how to follow anyone who tweets at me and/or mentions Nicki Minaj (latter might lead to spam issues)?
