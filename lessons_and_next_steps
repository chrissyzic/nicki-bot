Lessons:
- Get the right version of tweepy
- To debug: add a print statement after every single line and see where the code stops running
- You can also run the file in interactive mode (python -i [filename].py) to see the errors...can't remember if virtualenv needs to be activated for this

Next Steps:
- Change shuffle conditional to "if "shuffle" in request.lower()"
- Make the bot able to read mentions that start with a . 
- Autofollow anyone who mentions findnickisverse
- Analyze which songs have longer Nicki verses
- Weight the "shuffle" feature so that it returns longer Nicki verse more often
- Tweet an error to people who don't match a song title "didn't get that - try tweeting just the song title, no quotes or artist names please!
